A quantity or category that may vary from case to case. Two main types: Quantitative: a number Categorical: one of a set of discrete possibilities 11.6 Not in Tidy Data No units No footnotes Instead, this information should go into a codebook. Values and Cases need to be commensurate Same kind of thing for each case, e.g. don’t mix miles and km. Within a variable, only the same kind of value for each case. 11.7 Cases The object from which the variables were measured. Examples: A person, a country, an earthquake, a bike rental A person on a date A country in a year An earthquake and its aftershocks 11.8 Basic Knowledge What is each variable about. What is the kind of object that defines a case 11.9 Tidy Data Every value for each variable is the same kind of thing as all the other values for that variable. Every case is the same kind of thing as all the other cases. 11.10 Workflow: Creating a chain of evidence It’s important to be able to state definitely where your data came from. Part of this is not to edit your data. Once you have a table, don’t change anything in it. Instead, do your data-transformations in R so that you have a complete statement of how the data you collected are related to your analysis. 11.11 Summary Data Table: Rectangular format: cases (rows) and variables (columns) Separate analysis from data storage. Use a codebook to describe your cases and variables in detail Keep your data tidy "]

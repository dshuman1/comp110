Heiroglyph Mayan glyph 17.2 Data Glyph 17.2.1 A data glyph is also a mark, e.g. The features of a data glyph encodes the value of variables. Some are very simple, e.g. a dot: Some combine different elements, e.g. a pointrange: Some are complicated, e.g. a dotplot: See: http://docs.ggplot2.org/current/ 17.3 Data Glyph Properties: Aesthetics Aesthetics are visual properties of a glyph. Aesthetics for points: location (x and y), shape, color, size, transparency ## Warning: Using size for a discrete variable is not advised. Each glyph has its own set of aesthetics. 17.4 Why “Aesthetic”? 17.5 Some Graphics Components glyph The basic graphical unit that represents one case. Other terms used include mark and symbol. aesthetic a visual property of a glyph such as position, size, shape, color, etc. may be mapped based on data values: sex -&gt; color may be set to particular non-data related values: color is black scale A mapping that translates data values into aesthetics. example: male -&gt; blue; female -&gt; pink frame The position scale describing how data are mapped to x and y guide An indication for the human viewer of the scale. This allows the viewer to translate aesthetics back into data values. Examples: x- and y-axes, various sorts of legends 17.6 Scales The relationship between the variable value and the value of the aesthetic the variable is mapped to. Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) has units of mmHg (millimeters of mercury) Position on the x-axis measured in distance, e.g. inches. The conversion from SBP to position is a scale. Smoker is “never”, “former”, “current” Color is red, green, blue, … The conversion from Smoker to color is a scale. 17.7 Guides Guide: an indication to a human viewer of what the scale is. Example: Axis ticks and numbers Legends . . Labels on faceted graphics 17.8 Facets – using x and y twice x is determined by sbp and sex basically a separate frame for each sex 17.9 Designing Graphics Graphics are designed by the human expert (you!) in order to reveal information that’s latent in the data. 17.9.0.1 Design choices What kind of glyph, e.g. scatter, density, bar, … many others What variables constitute the frame. And some details: axis limits logarithmic axes, etc. What variables should be mapped to other aesthetics of the glyph. Whether to facet and with what variable. More details, …, e.g. setting of aesthetics to constants 17.10 Good and Bad Graphics Remember … Graphics are designed by the human expert (you!) in order to reveal information that’s latent in the data. Your choices depend on what information you want to reveal and convey. Learn by reading graphics and determining which ways of arranging thing are better or worse. A basic principle is that a graphic is about comparison. Good graphics make it easy for people to perceive things that are similar and things that are different. Good graphics put the things to be compared “side-by-side”, that is, in perceptual proximity to one another. 17.11 Perception and Comparison In roughly descending order of human ability to compare nearby objects: Position Length Area Angle Shape (but only a very few different shapes) Color Color is the most difficult, because it is a 3-dimensional quantity. - color gradients — we’re good at - discrete colors — must be carefully selected. 17.12 Count the ways this graphic is bad ## Warning: Using size for a discrete variable is not advised. 17.13 Glyph-Ready Data Glyph-ready data has this form: There is one row for each glyph to be drawn. The variables in that row are mapped to aesthetics of the glyph (including position) Glyph-ready data ## sbp dbp sex smoker ## 1 129 75 male never ## 2 105 62 female never ## 3 122 72 male never ## 4 128 83 female former ## 5 123 90 male former ## 6 122 77 male current Mapping of data to aesthetics sbp -&gt; x dbp -&gt; y smoker -&gt; color sex -&gt; shape Scales determine details of data -&gt; aesthetic translation 17.14 Layers – building up complex plots Each layer may have its own data, glyphs, aesthetic mapping, etc. one layer has points another layer has the curves 17.15 Stats: Data Transformations What are the glyphs, aesthetics, etc. for this plot? How is the data for this plot related to the “raw” data? ## sbp dbp sex smoker ## 1 129 75 male never ## 2 105 62 female never ## 3 122 72 male never ## 4 128 83 female former 17.16 What’s Next Eye-training recognize and describe glyphs, aesthetics, scales, etc. identify data required for a plot Data wrangling get data into glyph-ready format (dplyr, tidyr) Graphics construction start with: map variables to aesthetics interactively with scatterGraphHelper(), barGraphHelper(), densityGraphHelper() move on to: describe data, glyphs, aesthetics, etc. to R using ggplot2 "]

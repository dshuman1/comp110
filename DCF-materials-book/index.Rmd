description: "Notes and other materials for the Data Computing course at Macalester College: COMP 110"
---

This book contains class notes, activities, and projects used in the Data Computing class. Often, there are more activities and projects than we actually used.

The [*Data Computing*](Data-Computing.org) textbook has 18 chapters. These notes are divided into 8 parts, each of which corresponds to multiple chapters the textbook. This reflects the division of the course itself into eight components.

This is very much a work in progress. It's not yet complete and what's here may have many errors. Please do point out the problems so that these notes evolve in a positive way.

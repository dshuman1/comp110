# Conformity and Names

Calculate the total number of babies given the 10 most popular names each year as a fraction of the total number of babies born that year.

```{r}
Popular <- 
  BabyNames %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  filter(row_number(desc(count)) <= 10) %>%
  summarise(total_popular = sum(count)) 
AllNames <-
  BabyNames %>% 
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarise(total = sum(count))
```
 
```{r}
head(Popular)
head(AllNames)
```

Question: What would have happened if `group_by()` came after `filter()`?

We'll need an operation to combine two tables to find the proportion each year. Here's a teaser:
```{r}
AllNames %>%
  left_join(Popular) %>%
  mutate(pop_prop = total_popular / total) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = pop_prop)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  ylab("Conformity Index")
```

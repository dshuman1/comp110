We will be doing our work using R. There are several layers of sofware involved. It's helpful to have a bit of a map.

1. R is a language and system for doing scientific computing.
2. RStudio is a user interface (called an IDE --- Integrated Development Environment) that provides an editor and many other services for using R.
3. GitHub is a cloud-based system for collaborating on software and other kinds of projects. It's based on software called "git."  RStudio knows about git and GitHub.
4. Markdown
5. R/Markdown 
6. Packages

# Example: Joining for cleaning

Birds at the Ordway Nature Preserve

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(DataComputing)
View(OrdwayBirds)
help(OrdwayBirds)
```


```{r}
Birds <- 
  OrdwayBirds %>%
  select(Month, SpeciesName) %>%
  mutate(Month = as.numeric(Month))
```

* most common species
* most common species each month
* graph trappings for each species over the months


```{r}
Birds %>%
  left_join(Cleaned_species) %>%
  group_by(mSpeciesNameCleaned) %>%
  tally() %>%
  
  arrange(desc(n))
```


As a group, let's correct the species names using [this data table](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GDKeulVSRXL7Q_5Q0a7Offc_IPX2T4sZ80VN5VLASew/edit#gid=0).

* Count how many birds there are of each species in `OrdwayBirds` using the corrected species names.

# Untidy data: Galton's measurements of height

In the 1880s, Francis Galton started to make a mathematical theory of evolution. But the basic biology of heritability was not known: nothing about "genes" or DNA, etc. 

In order to create a theory, Galton needed a way to measure how traits are inherited from parents. To this end, he visited families in London and measured the heights of the parents and their (adult) children.

Here's part of a page from his lab notebook.

Divide into groups of 2 or 3 and translate the notebook data into a tidy form.

- Think about what would be an appropriate "case" for storing this data.
- What variables should there be?
- Open a spreadsheet and fill in a couple of rows of the tidy table that you envision.

Here are a few that have already been made:[Group-1](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Am13enSalO74dHNpejZtd3dQTXlPM245R0ZQbG0yYkE&usp=sharing), [Group-2](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Am13enSalO74dHk1enZoVnhrV09ad2x4dXR1MlpWNFE&usp=sharing), [Group-3](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Am13enSalO74dElIQkh0SWtyaW9aRkdMZVBERHdJNXc#gid=0), [Group-4](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Am13enSalO74dEYxdEhWZUI1S3NxN2ZaaThXSEtMVWc&usp=sharing), [Group-5](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Am13enSalO74dDVsLWJaUHV5emFVQlVfSjFrdmFkYXc&usp=sharing), [Group-6](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Am13enSalO74dFdvNGpFZkNuUHZqd2g2UEVDc0VEZEE&usp=sharing)

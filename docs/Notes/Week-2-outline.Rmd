# Outline of Class Session: Week 2

## Data Computing

### Administrivia

* We'll start grading at the end of September, so feel free to update any work you like. But remember the time budget for the course --- do not feel obliged to update things and definitely don't be a perfectionist for the sake of the grades.
* We'll score things 0 to 10. 
    - 8, 9, 10 means that you're getting the job done in a remarkably effective way.
    - 6, 7 means that you're demonstrating a reasonable understanding.
    - below 6 means that something isn't quite right. Let's get that straightened out.

# Data vs Information


What's the difference. Although they are often used synonomously, in this course ...

> Data is given; information is taken.

## The word "data":

**Dictionary etymology**: 1640s, plural of datum, from Latin *datum* "(thing) given," neuter past participle of *dare* "to give".  

**Historically**: Data (Greek: Δεδομένα, Dedomena) is a work by Euclid. It deals with the nature and implications of "given" information in geometrical problems. The subject matter is closely related to the first four books of Euclid's Elements. [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_(Euclid))

## The word "information"

The English word was apparently derived from the Latin stem (information-) of the nominative (informatio): this noun is derived from the verb informare (to inform) in the sense of "to give form to the mind", "to discipline", "instruct", "teach". [Source:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information)

**A Dictionary Definition**: knowledge acquired through experience or study [source](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/information)

## In this course

**Data** are measurements, observations, records, etc. of the sort that appear in a data table.

**Information** is the knowledge or belief that guides decisions or provides explanations.

### Our Task

Turn data into information.

## Data Reports

Knowledge and belief are attributes of the human mind.  

* Knowledge is belief that there is consensus about.

We derive knowledge and belief from our experiences including the statements of those we deem to have authority.

A **data report** is a presentation of data from which we are inclined to draw conclusions.  Some forms:

* A data table itself.  It must be small to be assimilated by us.
* A data graphic. Good data graphics are those that display patterns (or the lack thereof) in a form that is readily assimulated and faithful to the data being reported.
* A data model, such as a statistical model written in a mathematical formalism.

Data graphics can be interpreted without (much) specialized training.  Models typically require some specialized skills interpretation.

## Glyph-ready Data

Making data graphics can be straightforward so long as the data underlying the graphic are in the appropriate form.

* We'll call such a form **glyph-ready**.

**Data Wrangling** is the process of transforming or reshaping the data tables that arrive at our door into a glyph-ready form.

* The glyph-ready form depends on the kind of graphic you wish to make.
* Data reports in general also use data in glyph-ready form, so wrangling techniques useful for graphics are also useful for data modeling or the construction of short, human-interpretable tables.
